## **Project Summary** 

This project focuses on analyzing a Netflix dataset of movies and TV shows up to 2019, sourced from the third-party search engine Flixable. The primary objective is to enhance user experience through a content-based recommendation system, aiming to reduce subscriber churn for Netflix, which currently serves over 220 million users. By leveraging NLP techniques, the project seeks to group content into meaningful clusters, providing personalized recommendations that align with viewer preferences.

Beyond recommendation improvements, the dataset is analyzed to uncover key insights and emerging trends within the streaming entertainment industry.

### **Key Steps involved :**

* Data Preprocessing: Addressed null values and managed nested columns (e.g., director, cast, listed_in, country) to facilitate better data visualization.

* Attribute Binning: Categorized the rating attribute into distinct categories such as adult, children's, family-friendly, and not rated.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to identify critical factors contributing to subscriber churn and gain deeper insights into content consumption patterns.

* Clustering: Utilized attributes like director, cast, country, genre, rating, and description, which were tokenized, preprocessed, and vectorized using the TF-IDF vectorizer. Dimensionality reduction was achieved through PCA for performance enhancement.

* Clustering Algorithms: Applied K-Means Clustering and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering algorithms, determining the optimal number of clusters (4 for K-Means, 2 for hierarchical clustering) through various evaluation metrics.

* Recommendation System Development: Built a content-based recommendation system using a cosine similarity matrix to deliver personalized content suggestions, thereby reducing subscriber churn.

This project not only contributes to improving user retention for Netflix but also offers valuable insights into content creation and consumption trends within the streaming industry.




### **Tools & Technologies Used :**

* Python Language
* Pandas & Numpy Library
* Matplotlib Library
* Seaborn Library
* Folium Library
* ML Libraries like SciKit-learn, Scipy etc.
* ChatGPT (as an Virtual Assistant)
